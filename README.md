# Renamer Application

## Overview
The **Renamer Application** is a Python-based utility designed to simplify the renaming of video files and their corresponding subtitle files. The application provides a user-friendly graphical interface (using Tkinter) that allows users to select a folder, choose specific file extensions for videos and subtitles, and automate the renaming process to ensure file names match.

The application reads configuration options from a JSON file located in the userâ€™s config directory (`~/.config/renamer/config.json`), allowing flexibility and customization for various formats.

## Features
- **Batch Renaming**: Automatically rename video files and matching subtitles in bulk.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive graphical interface built with Tkinter.
- **Custom File Formats**: Supports multiple video and subtitle file formats, configurable through `config.json`.
- **Default Folder Selection**: Users can set a default folder for quick access.
- **Icon Support**: Application window displays a custom icon (PNG or ICO format).
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Linux and potentially other platforms where Python and Tkinter are supported.

## Requirements
- **Python 3**
- **Tkinter** (for the GUI)
- Required Python packages can be installed from `requirements.txt`
